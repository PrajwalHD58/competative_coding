###################### MINIMUM TRANSPORTATION(MINTRANS) #########################

As India's farmers are facing lot of problems for selling their Goods. Abhishek a young man from Sangli distric

decided to find effective way to maximize farmers profit , So he thought that he shoud minimize the transportation charges.

So he collected data of production & requirement of goos in sangli distric .Interestingly, he found that demand and supply is always the same.

Sangli distric villages are in one street & seperated by one unit distance, and every village  is a Producer or Importer.

So abhishek will by good from distributer & sell to importer village. 



As abhishek is not a programmer help him to find minimun transportation charge required.

Input
The first line of input consists of no, of test cases(T).

Each test case starts with the two numbers first is  of villages in Sangli distric (N) (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000).
 
& second p is denoting price reqired for transporting  one unit good for one unit distance.

The following line contains n integers a(1) to a(N) (-1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000).

If ai ≥ 0, it means that village i  wants to buy ai units of good.

If ai < 0, village wants to sell ai units  of good.

You may assume that the numbers ai sum up to 0.


Output
For each test case print the minimum amount of tranportation charge needed so that every villages have their demand fulfilled.

Example
Input:
2
5   3
5  -4  1  -3  1
6   1  
-1000  -1000  -1000  1000  1000  1000


Output:
18
9000

EXPLANATION for test case no. two:->
Abhishek will by good from village 3 & will sold two village 4 Hence 
tranportation charge equal to 1000*1=1000
simillarly bye from village 2 & 1 & sold two village 5 & 6 respectively 
charge=1000*3+1000*5=8000
Total chage=9000
